            <p>Fear is the path to the dark side ... fear leads to anger ... anger leads to hate…hate leads to
                suffering. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Always pass on what you have learned. Named
                must be your fear before banish it can. A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.</p>

            <p>>Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. Fear is the path to the dark side ... fear leads
                to anger ... anger leads to hate…hate leads to suffering. Do. Or do not. There is no try. When you look
                at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back. Always two there are, no more, no
                less. A master and an apprentice.</p>

                <p>Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side. Your weapons, you will not need them. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.</p>
